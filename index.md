This is my current blog that captures my academic journey and hosts my Capture-the-flag (CTF) write ups :)

# Academic

I completed my Master's in Cybersecurity at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany. I am now pursuing a PhD at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte focused on Software Supply Chain Security, with a particular interest in securing the build process.
